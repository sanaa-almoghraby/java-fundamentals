# Lab: 07 - Inheritance, day 2
1. Create a Shop class; a Shop should have a name, description, and number of dollar signs.
Implement a constructor for a Shop.
Implement a reasonable toString method for Shops.


 2. Create a Theater class; a Theater should have a name and all of the movies currently showing there. (Strings are fine for the movies; no need to create another class.)
Implement a constructor for a Theater.
Write addMovie and removeMovie instance methods that allow the theater to update which movies are being shown.
Implement a reasonable toString method for Theaters.

3. Some reviews should now have a String movie instance variable, to hold which movie that reviewer is referencing.
Make sure that someone reviewing a Restaurant or a Shop doesn’t have to include which movie they saw!
It’s also okay if someone doesn’t want to include the movie they saw when they’re reviewing a theater (maybe they just went in for the popcorn).
Add testing for any new functionality you’ve created.
